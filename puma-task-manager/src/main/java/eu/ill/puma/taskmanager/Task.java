/**
 * The Task class encapsulates unitary tasks of work that are handled by the TaskManager. This class is overloaded to
 * perform unique pieces of work.
 *
 * Tasks are run on the TaskDispatcher which handles the multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * Tasks can be synchronised by calling the "get" method, which also returns any data obtained once the task has
 * completed.
 *
 * Tasks can be chained meaning that once the task has run it can produce a new task to be put into the task queue.
 *
 * Tasks can be re-run meaning that the same task can be automatically placed onto the task queue once it has
 * terminated.
